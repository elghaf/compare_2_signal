In this data science challenge focused on online signature verification, also known as biometric signature verification, participants are tasked with analyzing and classifying signatures for authentication purposes. The folder labeling follows a specific structure to organize the data effectively.

the labeling of folder are like that 

*Task 1:
 
	-U{id of user}S{id of signature}

	-U21S10 means user id 21 signature NÂ° 10

	-the 1st line of signature file , is the total number of lines

- signature is written as followed :

	x-coordinate, y-coordinate, time stamp, button status, azimuth, altitude, pressure

Dictionary :  


  X-coordinate  - scaled cursor position along the x-axis
  Y-coordinate  - scaled cursor position along the y-axis
  Time stamp    - system time at which the event was posted
  Button status - current button status (0 for pen-up and
                  1 for pen-down)
  Azimuth       - clockwise rotation of cursor about the z-axis : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth 
  Altitude      - angle upward toward the positive z-axis
  Pressure      - adjusted state of the normal pressure
